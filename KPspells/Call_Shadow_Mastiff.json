Each creature within a 30-foot cone of the mastiff must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the mastiff by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Bay of shadow mastiffs for the next 24 hours.<br><em><strong>Shadow Stealth.</strong></em> As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, the mastiff takes the Hide action.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
