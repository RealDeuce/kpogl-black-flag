      "value": "<p>You draw on the power of a historic fire, drought, or heat wave that happened within the past 100 years within 1 mile of you. You then release the condensed memory of that event in a blast that erupts in a 30-foot radius from you. When you cast this spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to be unaffected by it. The blast causes one of the following effects of your choice:<br><em><strong>Desiccate.</strong></em> Nearby water rapidly evaporates, including the water within creatures. A body or container of water in the spell’s area that fills a 10-foot cube or less evaporates instantly, including water in containers that are being worn or carried by creatures in the area. Each creature in the spell’s area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures made mostly of water, such as water elementals, have disadvantage on the saving throw.<br><em><strong>Swelter.</strong></em> The temperature of the air around you rises dramatically. Each creature in the spell’s area must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering 2 levels of exhaustion on a failed save, or only 1 level of exhaustion on a successful one.<br><em><strong>Wind.</strong></em> Hot wind explodes out from you. Each Tiny creature with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower in the area that doesn’t have total cover from you immediately dies. Each Small or larger creature in the spell’s area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 fire damage and is pushed away from you up to the edge of the spell’s area and knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
