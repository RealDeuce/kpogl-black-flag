      "value": "<p>A wall of writhing, animated humanoid hands appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The hands reach out from both sides of the wall. The wall blocks line of sight.<br>If the wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). Any creature that enters a space within 5 feet of the wall or starts its turn within 5 feet of the wall must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled and has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the start of its next turn. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is not grappled but still has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability check rolls.<br>Additionally, you can cast a spell with a range of touch and have the spell originate from a point on the wall instead of from you.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
