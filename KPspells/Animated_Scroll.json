      "value": "<p>The paper or parchment must be folded into the shape of an animal before casting the spell. It then becomes an animated paper animal of the kind the folded paper most closely resembles. The creature uses the stat block of any beast that has a challenge rating of 0. It is made of paper, not flesh and bone, but it can do anything the real creature can do: a paper owl can fly and attack with its talons, a paper frog can swim without disintegrating in water, and so forth. It follows your commands to the best of its ability, including carrying messages to a recipient whose location you know.<br>You canâ€™t have more than one animated paper animal at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have an animated paper animal, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose any beast that has a challenge rating of 0. Your animated paper animal transforms into the chosen creature.<br>The duration increases by 24 hours at 5th level (48 hours), 11th level (72 hours), and 17th level (96 hours).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
