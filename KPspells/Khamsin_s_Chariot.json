      "value": "<p>You create a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air on a point you can see within range. Each Huge or smaller creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn within 5 feet of the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. A creature restrained by the whirlwind can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained and is safely ejected into an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the whirlwind.<br>As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the whirlwind up to 30 feet. If you move the whirlwind, creatures restrained by the whirlwind are moved with it when it moves. If you move the whirlwind into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against being restrained by the cylinder, and the whirlwind stops moving this turn. If you are within 5 feet of the whirlwind when it moves, you can choose to be carried along with it and safely deposited in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of its destination. You can’t be restrained by the whirlwind.<br>Alternatively, as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can choose to violently eject a creature restrained by the whirlwind instead of moving the whirlwind. The creature is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the whirlwind’s radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
