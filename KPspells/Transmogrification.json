      "value": "<p>You elevate your body to a higher form. When you cast the spell, choose three of the forms described below and indicate which one’s effects will occur first. While the spell lasts, you can use a bonus action to exchange one of your choices for an unused one, or to make a new choice when the current one ends. The spell ends when its duration expires or when you expend all available uses of the third form you adopt.<br><em><strong>Wings.</strong></em> You sprout wings from your shoulders and gain a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings can be batlike or feathered.<br><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> You gain a breath weapon of one of these types of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can use an action to unleash your breath weapon in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 8d6 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. The breath weapon is considered a magical attack. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.<br><em><strong>Limbs.</strong></em> Appendages resembling tentacles, spider legs, pincers, or something else of your choosing sprout from your body. Choose slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage; you can use an action to make two melee weapon attacks with your new limbs, and each attack deals 2d12 damage of the chosen type. You are proficient with these weapons, and they have the reach and finesse properties.<br><em><strong>Radiating Light.</strong></em> You emit light in a 10-foot radius. The light can come from a halo, from ghostly flames, from your eyes, or any other source you choose. The light deals your choice of necrotic, fire, or radiant damage. A creature that passes through the light on its turn or that ends its turn in the light takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.<br><em><strong>Regeneration.</strong></em> You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.<br><em><strong>Overwhelming Might.</strong></em> When you hit a target with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.<br><em><strong>Frightening Presence.</strong></em> As an action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you. Each of them must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your frightening presence for the next 24 hours. You can use this ability up to three times, and it expires after the third use.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
