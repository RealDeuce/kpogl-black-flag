      "value": "<p>You touch an ordinary, properly pitched canvas tent to create a space where you and a companion can sleep in comfort. From the outside, the tent appears normal, but inside it has a small foyer and a larger bedchamber. The foyer contains a writing desk with a chair; the bedchamber holds a soft bed large enough to sleep two, a small nightstand with a candle, and a small clothes rack. The floor of both rooms is a clean, dry, hard-packed version of the local ground. When the spell ends, the tent and the ground return to normal, and any creatures inside the tent are expelled to the nearest unoccupied spaces.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When the spell is cast using a 3rd-level slot, the foyer becomes a dining area with seats for six and enough floor space for six people to sleep, if they bring their own bedding. The sleeping room is unchanged. With a 4th-level slot, the temperature inside the tent is comfortable regardless of the outside temperature, and the dining area includes a small kitchen. With a 5th-level slot, an unseen servant is conjured to prepare and serve food (from your supplies). With a 6th-level slot, a third room is added that has three two-person beds. With a slot of 7th level or higher, the dining area and second sleeping area can each accommodate eight persons.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
