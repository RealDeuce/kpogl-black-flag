      "value": "<p>You sing or play a tune that fills creatures that can hear the tune with unrestrained energy. Each creature of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target must use its reaction to throw one object or creature it is holding, which can include a grappled creature, or pick up and throw the nearest object within its reach if it isn’t holding anything. An object the same size or smaller than the thrower is thrown up to 30 feet in a random direction. A creature the same size as the thrower is thrown up to 15 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a creature is smaller than the thrower, the creature is thrown an additional 10 feet for each size category of difference between it and the thrower.<br>If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is a creature and is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.<br>A creature or object larger than the thrower can’t be thrown.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s range increases by 5 feet and the distance a creature or object is thrown increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
