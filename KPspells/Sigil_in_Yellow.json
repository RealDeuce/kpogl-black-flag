      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deep Magic: </strong>Void</em><br>When you cast this spell, you paint a sigil either upon a surface (such as on a wall or an object) or within an object that can be closed (such as in a book, treasure chest, or cabinet) to conceal the sigil. Regardless of where it is placed, the sigil must be a minimum of 6 inches in diameter and can be no larger than 10 feet in diameter.<br>A humanoid that gazes upon the sigil must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be forced to stare at it for 1 minute. If you are on the same plane of existence as the creature gazing at the sigil, you are alerted to their attention and can choose to do one of the following things:<ul><li>Perceive the target’s surroundings using its senses.</li><li>Read the target’s surface thoughts and determine what was on its mind the moment before its attention was seized by the sigil. On subsequent rounds, you can dig deeper into the target’s mind and gain insight into its emotional state and one item that looms large in its mind. If you choose this latter option, the target can make a new Wisdom saving throw, freeing itself of your influence on a success.</li><li>Take total and precise control of the target. On its turn, the target takes only the actions you choose and doesn’t do anything you don’t allow it to do. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw, freeing itself of your influence on a success.</li><li>You can use your action on each of your turns to change the effect the sigil has on the target. You remain connected to the target for 1 week or until it frees itself of your influence.</li><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
