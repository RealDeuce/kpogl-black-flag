      "value": "<p>You create a snare on a point you can see within range. You can leave the snare as a magical trap, or you can use your reaction to trigger the trap when a Large or smaller creature you can see moves within 10 feet of the snare. If you leave the snare as a trap, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to find the trap.<br>When a Large or smaller creature moves within 5 feet of the snare, the trap triggers. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically pulled into the air. The creature is restrained and hangs upside down 5 feet above the snareâ€™s location for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, escaping the snare on a success. Alternatively, a creature, including the restrained target, can use its action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by 5 or more, the snare is destroyed instead.<br>This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional snare for each slot level above 2nd. When you receive the mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which snare was triggered if you have more than one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
