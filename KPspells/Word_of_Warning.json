      "value": "<p>You use a creature’s name to bind its will, reducing its effectiveness against you. Choose a creature you can see within range. You must speak at least one name to which the target will answer or with which the target identifies, though you need not know its language. The name can’t be vague, like “ogre,” but it doesn’t have to be the creature’s actual name. For example, the local legend name of “Ol’ Gold Eye” for an ogre with a golden false eye can suffice, if the target often identifies itself as such, if the target is accustomed to answering to the name, or if the name is regularly used by others to define the target.<br>The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on saving throws against its spells and abilities until the spell ends.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can allow one friendly creature to be included in the benefits of this spell against the target for each slot level above 3rd. You and each of the friendly creatures you want to include must be within 30 feet of each other when you cast this spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
