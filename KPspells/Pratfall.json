      "value": "<p>You cause a small bit of bad luck to befall a creature, making it look humorously foolish. When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause one creature you can see within range to experience one of the following effects. A creature can experience only one of these effects at a time.<br><em><strong>Clothing Malfunction.</strong></em> An invisible force sharply tugs on the target’s trousers, causing their clothing to slip. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes with a two-handed weapon or it loses its shield bonus to its AC (your choice) until the end of its next turn as it uses one hand to gather itself.<br><em><strong>Disorienting Clap.</strong></em> The target feels the sensation of a quick, mild clap against its ears, briefly disorienting it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it can’t cast spells with somatic components until the end of its next turn.<br><em><strong>Flash of Lights.</strong></em> Strobing lights flash briefly before your target’s eyes, causing difficulties with its vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its passive Perception is halved until the end of its next turn.<br><em><strong>Slippery Floor.</strong></em> A small, oily puddle appears under the target’s feet, causing it to lose balance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be unable to use bonus actions on its next turn as it regains its footing and balance.<br><em><strong>Sneezing Fit.</strong></em> Tiny particles blow in your target’s face, causing it to sneeze. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
