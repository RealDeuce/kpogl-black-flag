      "value": "<p>A creature of your choice within range is overcome with a need to consume the flesh of its own kind. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its teeth become needlelike, and it becomes able to pinpoint creatures of the same type as it within 150 feet by scent. On its turn, the creature must move toward the nearest creature of its type by the fastest means possible. If it is within 5 feet of a creature of its type it must use its bonus action to make a bite attack against it. Your target has proficiency with its bite attack and deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier. If a creature of its type is not present within 150 feet of the target, it must attack the closest living creature to it.<br>At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, the target can make a new saving throw. The target has advantage on its saving throw if it is triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends, and the target is poisoned for 1 hour, unless it is a cannibal or comes from a cannibalistic culture.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
