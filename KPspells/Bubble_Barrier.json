      "value": "<p>A translucent but solid sphere of water encloses a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.<br>Creatures can’t pass through the bubble, but physical objects, energy, or other spell effects can. The bubble has an AC equal to your spell save DC and hit points equal to twice your spell save DC. The spell ends for the enclosed creature if the bubble is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature inside the bubble has three-quarters cover from attacks outside the bubble, and creatures outside the bubble have half cover from attacks from the enclosed creature. When the enclosed creature would take damage from an attacker or effect outside the bubble, the creature can choose to take only half the damage and reduce the bubble’s hit points by an amount equal to the other half of the damage.<br>The bubble is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature inside of it. When the enclosed creature moves, the bubble moves with it. If the bubble was created in an area with air, the bubble contains enough air for a breathing creature contained within it to breathe for the duration of the spell. If the bubble was created in an area of water, the bubble contains enough water for a water-breathing creature to breathe for the duration of the spell.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bubble’s hit points increase by 10 for each slot level above 2nd.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
