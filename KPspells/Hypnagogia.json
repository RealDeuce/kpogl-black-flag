If it fails, choose one of the following effects. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected by this spell.<br><em><strong>Sleep Paralysis.</strong></em> Overwhelming heaviness and fatigue overcome the creature, slowing it.The creature’s speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on weapon attacks.<br><em><strong>Phantasmata.</strong></em> The creature imagines vivid and terrifying hallucinations centered on a point of your choice within range. For the duration, the creature is frightened, and it must take the Dash action and move away from the point you chose by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.<br><em><strong>False Awakening.</strong></em> The creature enters a trancelike state of consciousness in which it’s not fully aware of its surroundings. It can’t take reactions, and it must roll a d4 at the beginning of its turn to determine its behavior. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.<table><tr><th>d4</th><th>Behavior</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The creature takes the Dash action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The creature uses its action to pantomime preparing for its day: brushing teeth and hair, bathing, eating, or similar activity.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The creature moves up to its speed toward a randomly determined creature and uses its action to make one melee attack against that creature. If there is no creature within range, the creature does nothing this turn.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The creature does nothing this turn.</td></tr></table><br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</table><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
