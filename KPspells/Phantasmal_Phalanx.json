Each soldier is considered Celestial, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.<br>The soldiers are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the soldiers as a group, which has its own turns. You can communicate telepathically with the soldiers as long as you are on the same plane of existence, and the soldiers obey any commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the soldiers, they defend themselves from hostile creatures or position themselves protectively next to you and your allies, each soldier moving to within 5 feet of at least one of you. While positioned protectively, a soldier can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll against the target it is protecting, provided the target remains within 5 feet of the soldier.<br>The GM has the soldiers’ statistics, using a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.qQcu0AgHe762M5Gh]{veteran} that has a shield and is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
