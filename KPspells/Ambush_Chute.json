No more than five creatures can transit the passage at the same time.<br>When the spell ends and the trapdoors disappear, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest the end of the passage closest to them.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the passage and the distance you can place the second trapdoor increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
