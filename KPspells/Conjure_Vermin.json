Choose one of the following options for what appears:<ul><li>One swarm of maggots (use the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.UBFzn2d2RnVgO8Rl]{swarm of insects} [beetle])</li><li>Two swarms of crows (use the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.nI8fNmp3yL83G8fR]{swarm of ravens})</li><li>Two @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8ihbbjkaOFTPbI73]{swarms of rats}</li><br>Each swarm is also considered a Fiend, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned swarms are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the swarms as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.<br>Until this spell ends, you can use an action to force one of the swarms you control to cause one of the following effects, based on the type of swarm. Once you use this action, that swarm disappears.<li><strong>Swarm of Crows.</strong> One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</li><li><strong>Swarm of Maggots.</strong> One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned with horror and nausea until the end of its next turn.</li><li><strong>Swarm of Rats.</strong> One creature in the swarm’s space must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned by filth until the end of its next turn. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.</li><br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 4th-level slot, three times as many with a 6th-level slot, and four times as many with an 8th-level slot.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
