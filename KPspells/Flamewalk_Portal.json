      "value": "<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a small rune next to a source of fire. The source can be a fireplace, campfire, signal beacon, or other source of fire that is large enough for a Medium creature to stand in the fire. This rune lasts for 30 days, and it remains even if the fire is extinguished.<br>For the duration, when you cast this spell again, you can link any two runes together to form a gateway between the two locations. The two runes linked in this way must be on the same plane of existence, and each rune must have an active fire source within 5 feet of it. While casting this spell, you know if a rune you inscribed has an active fire source within 5 feet of it. For 1 minute or until you end the effect as a bonus action, any creature within 5 feet of one of the fire sources can use 5 feet of its movement to step into that fire source and exit from the other fire source, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the destination fire source. A creature doesnâ€™t take fire damage from stepping into the fire. When this effect ends, the runes disappear from both locations, ending the spell if those were the only two runes inscribed with this spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
