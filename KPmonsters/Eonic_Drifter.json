His eyes scan the hall in panic, witnessing an event only he can see.</em><br><em><strong>Adrift in Time.</strong></em> Not much is known about the time-traveling eonic drifters other than that they were humans who left a dying civilization to look for help not available in their own age. To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved much more difficult than leaving it, and the eonic drifters found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with much of their vitality. They have become gaunt and semi‑mummified by the passing of ages.<br><em><strong>Crystal Belts.</strong></em> A drifter carries an odd assembly of gear gathered in countless centuries. It barters with these goods when necessary. The more eclectic the collection, the more jumps it has performed on its odyssey. Belts of crystals around its body store the energy that fuels a drifter’s travels. After each large jump through time, the reservoirs are exhausted for awhile, allowing only short jumps. Jittery and Paranoid. Visiting countless eras in which mankind has all but forgotten their once-great civilization has robbed most eonic drifters of their hope. Their greatest fear is being robbed of their crystal belts, which are their only remaining links to the people they once were. They plead or fight to the death for the belts.<br><em><strong>Ruins Dwellers.</strong></em> Drifters can appear at any time or place, but they often frequent the sites of their people’s past (or future) cities. There they are comforted by knowing that they’re at least in the right place, if not the right time.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}"
