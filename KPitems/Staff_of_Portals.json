      "value": "<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)</em><br>This iron-shod wooden staff is heavily worn, and it can be wielded as a quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all of its magic and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br>While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.JVimVp4IvmQTO52h]{arcane lock}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.a79cPbF5G33jiDBa]{dimension door}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.KW9pI3ghpmz6J5T1]{knock}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.IWRO3njx4Jym0qZc]{passwall}</em> (5 charges).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
