These rare blades offer diviners a powerful weapon on the front lines of combat. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.<br><em><strong>Fate Slice.</strong></em> If you know at least one spell from the divination school, whenever you hit with an attack using this weapon, you may use your reaction to expend a spell slot. If you do, that creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
