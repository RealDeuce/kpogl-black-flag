      "value": "<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>This gnarled and twisted oak staff has numerous thorns growing from its surface. Green vines tightly wind their way up along the shaft. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the thorns immediately fall from the staff and it becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.SdIMnQDBbxLsMocU]{barkskin}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.CM2MI0J59OeCL7I4]{entangle}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.HY9kiXpgSNSWwG4w]{speak with plants}</em> (3 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.881NeWKz2mfAQ4kT]{spike growth}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.XGuKqLPyauHx0WyS]{wall of thorns}</em> (6 charges).<br><em><strong>Thorned Strike.</strong></em> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
