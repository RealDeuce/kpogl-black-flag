      "value": "<p><em>Potion, legendary</em><br>This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes 12d6 poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw.<br>Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Mh63lcux34kr5pO7]{forbiddance}</em> spell with a duration of one year. Unlike the spell, black elixir doesn't incorporate a password and only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Mh63lcux34kr5pO7]{forbiddance}</em> effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.<br><em><strong>Ingredients:</strong></em> the heart of a marut, the powdered horn of a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
