      "value": "<p><em>Potion, very rare</em><br>This potionâ€™s container holds a gritty liquid that moves and pours like water filled with fine particles of sand. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.fUkZjWTGW0wFntSB]{gaseous form}</em> spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. While in this gaseous form, your appearance is that of a vortex of spiraling sand instead of a misty cloud. In addition, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in a sandy environment, and, while motionless in a sandy environment, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary swirl of sand.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
