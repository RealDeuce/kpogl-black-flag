      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>These white gloves have elegant tailoring and size themselves perfectly to fit your hands. The gloves must be attuned to a specific, habitable place with walls, a roof, and doors before you can attune to them. To attune the gloves to a location, you must leave the gloves in the location for 24 hours. Once the gloves are attuned to a location, you can attune to them.<br>While you wear the gloves, you can unlock any nonmagical lock within the attuned location by touching the lock, and any mundane portal you open in the location while wearing these gloves opens silently.<br>As an action, you can snap your fingers and every nonmagical portal within 30 feet of you immediately closes and locks (if possible) as long as it is unobstructed. (Obstructed portals remain open.) Once used, this property of the gloves can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
