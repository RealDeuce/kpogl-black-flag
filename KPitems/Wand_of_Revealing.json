      "value": "<p><em>Wand, uncommon</em><br>Crystal beads decorate this wand, and a silver hand, index finger extended, caps it. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of the wandâ€™s charges to reveal one creature or object within 120 feet of you that is either invisible or ethereal. This works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.3MMJmBI63gipqU9b]{see invisibility}</em> spell, except it allows you to see only that one creature or object. That creature or object remains visible as long as it remains within 120 feet of you. If more than one invisible or ethereal creature or object is in range when you use the wand, it reveals the nearest creature or object, revealing invisible creatures or objects before ethereal ones.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
