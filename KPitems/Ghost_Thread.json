      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>Most of this miles-long strand of enchanted silk, created by phase spiders, resides on the Ethereal Plane. Only a few inches at either end exist permanently on the Material Plane, and those may be used as any normal string would be. Creatures using it to navigate can follow one end to the other by running their hand along the thread, which phases into the Material Plane beneath their grasp. If dropped or severed (AC 8, 1 hit point), the thread disappears back into the Ethereal Plane in 2d6 rounds.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
