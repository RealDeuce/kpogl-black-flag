      "value": "<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This white crystalline rod is shaped like an icicle. The rod has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The rod launches an icicle at the target and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and 2d6 cold damage. On a critical hit, the target is also paralyzed until the end of its next turn as it momentarily freezes.<br>If you take fire damage while holding this rod, you become immune to fire damage for 1 minute, and the rod loses 2 charges. If the rod has only 1 charge remaining when you take fire damage, you become immune to fire damage, as normal, but the rod melts into a puddle of water and is destroyed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
