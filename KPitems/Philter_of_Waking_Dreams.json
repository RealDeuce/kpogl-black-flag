      "value": "<p><em>Potion, Uncommon</em><br>As you imbibe this potion, you remember a particular scene of importance, such as aduel, kiss, theft, betrayal, murder, or funeral—the specific memories depend on the philter’s creator. You can take no action for 1 round while caught up in these memories and thereafter cannot forget these events: any creature seen in such a memory will be remembered, as well as their name, by you as someone you have seen before. With a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, you may note details of importance within the waking dream, including the relationships of people within the dream, their status, and the location of the dream.<br>False memories cannot be created via a <em>philter of waking dreams</em>, though what the imbiber remembers may be colored by time or strong emotion.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
