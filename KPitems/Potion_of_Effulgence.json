      "value": "<p><em>Potion, common</em><br>When you drink this potion, your skin glows with radiance, and you are filled with joy and bliss for 1 minute. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. While glowing, you are blinded and have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. If a creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait starts its turn in the bright light you shed, it takes 2d4 radiant damage. This potionâ€™s golden liquid sparkles with motes of sunlight.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
