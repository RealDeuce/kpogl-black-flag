      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (sling bullet), uncommon</em><br>This sling stone is carved with an open mouth that screams in hellish torment when hurled with a sling. Typically, 1d4 + 1 <em>sling stones of screeching</em> are found together. When you fire the stone from a sling, it changes into a screaming bolt, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 30 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the sling stone plus 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone.<br>Once a <em>sling stone of screeching</em> has dealt its damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical sling stone.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
