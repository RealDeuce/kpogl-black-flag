      "value": "<p><em>Potion, Uncommon</em><br>As you imbibe this potion, you are overtaken with memories and feelings from a time of physical desire—the specific memories depend on the philter’s creator. You must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome by a fit of lust for 1 minute. While in a fit of lust, you seek out either a person whose affection you desire or, more rarely, an object of consuming passion (usually a token, trophy, or fetish of some kind) to claim for yourself. On a successful saving throw, only the memories are passed to you. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
