      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This leathery mass of dried meat was once a humanoid heart, taken from an individual that died while experiencing great terror. You can use an action to whisper a command word and hurl the heart to the ground, where it revitalizes and begins to beat rapidly and loudly for 1 minute. Each creature withing 30 feet of the heart has disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. At the end of the duration, the heart bursts from the strain and is destroyed.<br>The heart can be attacked and destroyed (AC 11; hp 3; resistance to bludgeoning damage). If the heart is destroyed before the end if its duration, each creature within 30 feet of the heart must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
