      "value": "<p><em>Armor (hide), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This thick and rough armor is made from the hide of a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPngobou00000000]{ngobou}, an aggressive, ox-sized dinosaur known to threaten elephants of the plains. The horns and tusks of the dinosaur are worked into the armor as spiked shoulder pads. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have a magical sense for elephants. You automatically detect if an elephant has passed within 90 feet of your location within the last 24 hours, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to find elephants.<br><em><strong>Ngobou Charge.</strong></em> If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Elephants have disadvantage on this saving throw. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
