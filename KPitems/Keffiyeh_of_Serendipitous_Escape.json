      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>This checkered cotton headdress is indistinguishable from the mundane scarves worn by the desert nomads. As an action, you can remove the headdress, spread it open on the ground, and speak the command word. The keffiyeh transforms into a 3-foot by 5-foot <em>carpet of flying</em> which moves according to your spoken directions provided that you are within 30 feet of it. Speaking the command word a second time transforms the carpet back into a headdress again.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
