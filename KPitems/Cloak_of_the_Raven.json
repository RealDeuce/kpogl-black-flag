      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em><br>While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. In an area of dim light or sunlight, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 30 feet. If you release the cloak’s edges from your grasp while flying in this way or if you are no longer in dim light or sunlight, you lose this flying speed.<br>While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or sunlight, you can use your action to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.3jd8F4gxhlXMT4et]{daylight}</em> as a readied action. You may then fly or carry the daylight spell into any area of darkness. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
