The armor is immune to necrotic damage and rusting attacks such as those of a rust monster. While wearing this armor, your maximum hit points can’t be reduced.<br>As an action, you can speak a command word to gain the effect of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.gBis1QK0mfhwc26a]{protection from evil and good}</em> spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). While the spell is active, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
