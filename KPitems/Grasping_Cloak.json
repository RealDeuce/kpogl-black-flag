      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Made of strips of black leather, this cloak always shines as if freshly oiled. The strips writhe and grasp at nearby creatures. While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to grapple a creature no more than one size larger than you within 5 feet of you. The strips make the grapple attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target is grappled by the cloak, leaving your hands free to perform other tasks or actions that require both hands. However, you are still considered to be grappling a creature, limiting your movement as normal. The cloak can grapple only one creature at a time.<br>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to aid you in grappling. If you do so, you have advantage on your next attack roll made to grapple a creature. While grappling a creature in this way, you have advantage on the contested check if a creature attempts to escape your grapple.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
