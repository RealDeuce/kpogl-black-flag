While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shieldâ€™s normal bonus to AC.<br><em><strong>Grasping Defense.</strong></em> When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee weapon attack, you can use a reaction to animate the hand on the shield. Make a melee weapon attack with the shield. You have proficiency with this attack if you are proficient with shields, and you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the attacker is grappled (escape DC 13) by the hand. While the shield is grappling a creature, you gain no bonuses to AC from the shield. The grapple ends when you can command the shield to release the target (no action required), when the creature escapes, or when you drop the shield.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
