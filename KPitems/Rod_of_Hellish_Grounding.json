      "value": "<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This curious jade rod is tipped with a knob of crimson crystal that glows and shimmers with eldritch phosphorescence. While holding or carrying the rod, you have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.<br><em><strong>Hellish Desiccation.</strong></em> While holding this rod, you can use an action to fire a crimson ray at an object or creature made of metal that you can see within 60 feet of you. The ray forms a 5-foot wide line between you and the target. Each creature in that line that isn’t a construct or an undead must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures and objects made of metal are unaffected. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is desiccated.<br>A desiccated creature is reduced to a withered corpse, but everything it is wearing and carrying is unaffected. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.NRAGNLv32xGsz1b0]{true resurrection}</em> or a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.TB5mhD1xitrWMfX6]{wish}</em> spell.
