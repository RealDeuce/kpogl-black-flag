      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This black, six-petaled flower fits neatly on a garment’s lapel or peeking out of a pocket. While wearing it, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, or frightened.<br>While wearing the flower, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to invoke the corsage’s power and cause one of the following effects:<ul><li>When you speak the first command word, you gain blindsight out to a range of 120 feet for 1 hour.</li><li>When you speak the second command word, choose a target within 120 feet of you and make a ranged attack with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage.</li><li>When you speak the third command word, your form shifts and shimmers. For 1 minute, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.</li><br>Each time you use the flower, one of its petals curls in on itself. You can’t use the flower if all of its petals are curled. The flower uncurls 1d6 petals daily at dusk.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
