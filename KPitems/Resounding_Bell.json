      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard)</em><br>When you are concentrating on a spell, you can ring this golden bell each round as a bonus action to trigger its magic. From the time the bell is rung until the beginning of your next turn, you gain advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration of the spell. Magic that stops sound, such as silence, render the bell inoperable until it can be heard again.<br>If you fail a Constitution save to maintain a spell, you can use a reaction to choose to succeed on the save instead. You maintain concentration of the spell for the remainder of the duration, as long as you continue to use your bonus action to ring the bell. The spell ends if you do not ring the bell to maintain concentration. Once this power of the bell is used, it cannot be used again until you have completed a long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
