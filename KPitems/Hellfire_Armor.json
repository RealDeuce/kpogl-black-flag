      "value": "<p><em>Armor (any metal), rarity varies</em><br>This spiked armor is a dark, almost black crimson when inactive.<br><em><strong>Hellfire Armor (Common).</strong></em> While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cause it to glow and appear red-hot, giving you a hellish appearance. The armor sheds light as a candle, but it doesn’t emit heat. The effect lasts until you use a bonus action to end it.<br><em><strong>Molten Hellfire Armor (Uncommon).</strong></em> This more powerful version of hellfire armor has 3 charges. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend 1 charge as part of the action to make the armor glow, you can make the armor emit heat in addition to light for 1 minute. For the duration, when a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 1d4 fire damage. You are immune to the armor’s heat while wearing it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
