Ravenfolk and other dwellers in the World Ash create these staffs to more easily travel its planar pathways.<br>You can perfectly recall any path you have traveled while holding this staff.<br>By striking the staff on the ground or against a branch of Yggdrasil as a bonus action, you can transform it into a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.l07uPF7XDuQGBNoe]{shillelagh}</em> (as the spell) for 1 minute.<br>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> You can use an action to expend one or more of the staffâ€™s charges to cast one of the following spells: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.JKOLGDy9N2dMsnDp]{create or destroy water}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.ebGqTLYBFxSDf3g7]{freedom of movement}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressspells.Item.KPlocateredporta]{locate Red Portal}</em> (3 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.4q0CXrxEdSaDWkPU]{purify food and drink}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.HY9kiXpgSNSWwG4w]{speak with plants}</em> (3 charges).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
