      "value": "<p><em>Potion, common</em><br>When you drink this tangy, violet liquid, your mind opens to new forms of communication. For 1 hour, if you spend 1 minute listening to creatures speaking a particular language, you gain the ability to communicate in that language for the duration. This potionâ€™s magic can also apply to non-verbal languages, such as a hand signal-based or dance-based language, so long as you spend 1 minute watching it being used and have the appropriate anatomy and limbs to communicate in the language.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
