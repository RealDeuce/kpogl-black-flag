      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>Found in a small packet, this coarse, foul-smelling black dust is made from the powdered remains of a celestial. Each packet of the substance contains enough ashes for one use.<br>You can use an action to throw the dust in a 15-foot cone. Each spellcaster in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for 1 hour or until the curse is ended with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.1CSuwbYVhlmZMNGM]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. Creatures that don’t cast spells are unaffected.<br>A cursed spellcaster must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw each time it casts a spell. On a success, the spell is cast normally. On a failure, the spellcaster casts a different, randomly chosen spell of the same level or lower from among the spellcaster’s prepared or known spells. The new spell’s target is the spellcaster’s original target, is placed in that target’s space, or is as close to that target as the spell’s range allows. If the new spell’s range is Self or if the spell targets only one creature and the target is out of range, the new spell affects the spellcaster. The GM randomly determines any other aspects of the spell, such as the wording of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.iw5BfQdWrDssHFWZ]{suggestion}</em> spell or the form of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> spell. If the spellcaster has no suitable spells available, no spell is cast.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
