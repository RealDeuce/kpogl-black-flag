      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to transform into a mountain ram (use the statistics of a giant goat). This effect works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> spell, except you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use an action to transform back into your original form.<br>Each time you transform into a ram in a single day, you retain the hit points you had the last time you transformed. If you were reduced to 0 hit points the last time you were a ram, you canâ€™t become a ram again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
