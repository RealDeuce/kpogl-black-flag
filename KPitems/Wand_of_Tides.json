      "value": "<p><em>Wand, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)</em><br>This wand has 5 charges. While holding it, you cannot be paralyzed. You can also use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to warp space around you, filling it with tangible shadows. All creatures moving toward you move as if they are in difficult terrain. Attack rolls against you have disadvantage. The shadows last for 3 rounds or until you choose to end them.<br>The wand regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand turns to ash and is destroyed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
