      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (Any Sword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>This blade seems to tremble slightly when you wield it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magical sword. As an action, you can plunge the <em>tremorblade</em> into the ground, triggering a localized earthquake centered on you.<br>Fissures open in the affected area, in a 30-foot radius from you. A total of 1d6 + 1 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is d10 × 10 feet deep and 10 feet wide, and it extends from one edge of the effect’s area to the opposite edge. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.<br>A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.tBmWXvs9kbMxZrzc]{earthquake}</em> spell). Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before using it again.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
