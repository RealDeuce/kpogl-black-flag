This lasts for up to 1 minute and is limited to only what the creature saw or heard in the final moments of its life. The orb canâ€™t show you what the creature might have detected using another sense, such as tremorsense.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
