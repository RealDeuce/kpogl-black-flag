If you move at least 15 feet in a single turn, all creatures within 10 feet of you at any point during your movement must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage and fall prone.<br>In addition, while wearing these boots, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.tBmWXvs9kbMxZrzc]{earthquake}</em>, requiring no concentration, by speaking a command word and jumping on a point on the ground. The spell is centered on that point. Once you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.tBmWXvs9kbMxZrzc]{earthquake}</em> in this way, you canâ€™t do so again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
