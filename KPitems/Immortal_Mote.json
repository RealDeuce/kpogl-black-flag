      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em><br>A fist-sized lump of self-contained, perpetually boiling quicksilver, an <em>immortal mote</em> is often kept in a glass flask where it softly roils and thrums. Twice per long rest, you may, as an action that does not provoke opportunity attacks, pour out a portion of the <em>mote</em> onto yourself or an adjacent creature.<br>The liquid metal immediately absorbs into your flesh, eliminating a level of exhaustion and permitting you to gain the benefits of a short rest, including spending Hit Dice to heal.<br>You may also spend 3 Hit Dice to cure a disease, eliminate a condition, or neutralize a poison. You may spend 6 Hit Dice to regenerate 5 hit points per round for 10 minutes unless affected by <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.t61I6zrmEDPdOLfw]{dispel magic}</em>. The immortal mote is a 7th-level effect for dispelling purposes.<br>If you have no levels of exhaustion when you apply it, gain 3 temporary Hit Dice which you may use to fuel the <em>immortal mote’s</em> effects. You may spend Hit Dice for the mote’s effects at any time until you take a long rest.<br>In addition, if you pour the entire <em>mote</em> into the mouth of a creature not dead for more than 10 minutes, they may be brought back to life as the raise dead spell, which consumes the mote.<br>As long as a portion of the mote remains, it regains any lost mass at dawn each day.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
