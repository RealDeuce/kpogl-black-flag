      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (Dagger), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This dagger has sharp wings encompassing its hilt guard, and the blade curves into a thick edge like a scorpion’s tail.<br>The dagger has 3 charges. If you attack and hit a diseased creature with this dagger, you can choose to inflict no damage and instead expend a charge to absorb the disease into the dagger, curing the target of the disease. You can choose to release one or more diseases stored in the dagger as part of a successful attack, causing an additional 3d8 poison damage for each disease expended. The dagger’s charges are regained on the next dawn after they are expended.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
