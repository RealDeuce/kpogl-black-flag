      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster of evil alignment)</em><br>Forged by creatures with firsthand knowledge of what lies between the stars, this dark gray blade sometimes appears to twitch or ripple like water when not directly observed. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. In addition, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.<br>You can use an action to cause the blade to ripple for 1 minute. While the blade is rippling, each creature that takes psychic damage from the dagger must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The dagger canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
