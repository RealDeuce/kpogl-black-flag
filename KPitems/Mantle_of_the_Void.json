      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While wearing this midnight-blue mantle covered in writhing runes, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws, and if you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half the damage or suffer partial effects, you instead take no damage and suffer none of the spell’s effects.<br><em><strong>Void-Powered Strike.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action to infuse your next spell or attack with power from the Void. Choose one creature that failed its saving throw against your spell or that was hit by your attack. That creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. Once used, you can’t use this property again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
