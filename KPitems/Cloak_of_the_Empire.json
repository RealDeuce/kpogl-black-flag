      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature of non-good alignment)</em><br>This voluminous grey cloak has bright red trim and the sigil from an unknown empire on its back. The cloak is stiff and doesnâ€™t fold as easily as normal cloth. Whenever you are struck by a ranged weapon attack, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage from that attack by your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
