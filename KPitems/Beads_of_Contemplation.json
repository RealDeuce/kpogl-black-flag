      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)</em><br>This strand of eight wooden beads, each cleverly carved with geometric patterns, hangs from a stout length of cording. The beads store ki energy placed into them, holding the ki until you use it. The beads can store up to 8 ki points. At the end of a short or long rest, you can place ki energy into the beads by touching them and expending a number of ki points equal to half your proficiency bonus.<br>While wearing or carrying the beads, you can use a bonus action to remove any number of ki points from the beads, regaining that amount of ki points and freeing up space in the beads.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
