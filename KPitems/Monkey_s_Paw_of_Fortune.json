      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This preserved monkey’s paw hangs on a simple leather thong. This paw helps you alter your fate. If you are wearing this paw when you fail an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll the roll with a +10 bonus. You must take the second roll. When you use this property of the paw, one of its fingers curls tight to the palm. When all five fingers are curled tightly into a fist, the <em>monkey’s paw</em> loses its magic.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
