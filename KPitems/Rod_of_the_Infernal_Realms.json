      "value": "<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>The withered, clawed hand of a demon or devil tops this iron rod. While holding this rod, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, and the save DC for your spells increases by 2.<br><em><strong>Frightful Eyes.</strong></em> While holding this rod, you can use a bonus action to cause your eyes to glow with infernal fire for 1 minute. While your eyes are glowing, a creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until your eyes stop glowing. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, you canâ€™t use this property again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
