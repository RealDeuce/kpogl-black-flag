If you are a Large creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Medium creatures, this ring makes you Medium. Similarly, if you are a Medium creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Large creatures, this ring makes you Large. These effects work like the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.ReN0VQRCHBtYmvst]{enlarge/reduce}</em> spell, except they persist as long as you wear the ring and satisfy the conditions.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
