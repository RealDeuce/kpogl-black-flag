      "value": "<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em><br>Green gas swirls inside this slender, glass wand. The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand shatters into hundreds of crystalline fragments, and the gas within it dissipates.<br><em><strong>Fog Cloud.</strong></em> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.cvyXEJ2dVH7aG5Px]{fog cloud}</em> spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.<br><em><strong>Gaseous Escape.</strong></em> When you are attacked while holding this wand, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of its charges to transform yourself and everything you are wearing and carrying into a cloud of green mist until the start of your next turn. While you are a cloud of green mist, you have resistance to nonmagical damage, and you can’t be grappled or restrained. While in this form, you also can’t talk or manipulate objects, any objects you were wearing or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with, and you can’t attack or cast spells.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
