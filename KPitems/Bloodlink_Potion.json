      "value": "<p><em>Potion, common</em><br>When you and another willing creature each drink at least half this potion, your life energies are linked for 1 hour.<br>When you or the creature who drank the potion with you take damage while your life energies are linked, the total damage is divided equally between you. If the damage is an odd number, roll randomly to assign the extra point of damage. The effect is halted while you and the other creature are separated by more than 60 feet. The effect ends if either of you drop to 0 hit points.
