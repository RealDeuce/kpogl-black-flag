      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Stylized etchings of cat-like lightning elementals known as @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPfulminar000000]{fulminars} cover the outer surfaces of these solid silver bracers. While wearing these bracers, lightning crackles harmless down your hands, and you have resistance to lightning damage and thunder damage.<br>The bracers have 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to create lightning shackles that bind up to two creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 4d6 lightning damage and is restrained for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isnâ€™t restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The bracers regain all expended charges daily at dawn. The bracers also regain 1 charge each time you take 10 lightning damage while wearing them.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
