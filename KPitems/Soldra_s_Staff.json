      "value": "<p><em>Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a wizard)</em><br>This staff is 5 feet long, made of yew wood that curves at its top, is iron shod at its mid-section, and capped with a silver dragon’s claw that holds a lustrous, though rough and uneven, black pearl. When you make an attack with this staff, it howls and whistles hauntingly like the wind. When you cast a spell from this staff, it chirps like insects on a hot summer night.<br>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br>It has 3 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.6dvUhdyeuOtRySf9]{faerie fire}</em> (1 charge) or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.0u1CqWulRC8QY1X6]{gust of wind}</em> (2 charges).<br>The staff regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Once daily, it can regain 1 expended charge by exposing the staff ’s pearl to moonlight for 1 minute.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
