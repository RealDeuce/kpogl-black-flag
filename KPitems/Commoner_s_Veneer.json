      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)</em><br>When you wear this simple, homespun scarf around your neck or head, it casts a minor glamer over you that makes you blend in with the people around you, avoiding notice. When in an area containing 25 or more humanoids, such as a city street, market place, or other public locale, Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot you amid the crowd have disadvantage. This item’s power only works for creatures of the humanoid type or those using magic to take on a humanoid form.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
