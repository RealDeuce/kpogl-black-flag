      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>The length of this wooden staff is carved with images of mouths whispering, speaking, and screaming. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. While holding this staff, you canâ€™t be deafened, and you can act normally in areas where sound is prevented, such as in the area of a silence spell. Any creature that is not deafened can hear your voice clearly from up to 1,000 feet away if you wish them to hear it.<br>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the mouths carved into the staff give a collective sigh and close, and the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.GbevEjvX63ddK3ZP]{divine word}</em> (7 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.dCyFS5bOYn7ar2R9]{magic mouth}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.VEYRZOPPA3yH6AeK]{speak with animals}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.er0d27qCTrTZkpu1]{speak with dead}</em> (3 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.HY9kiXpgSNSWwG4w]{speak with plants}</em> (3 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.8o61rhZ9I4vR9Vih]{word of recall}</em> (6 charges). You can also use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Pk6kPY9iPq5WT14T]{vicious mockery}</em> cantrip from the staff without using any charges.<br><em><strong>Thunderous Shout.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and release a chorus of mighty shouts in a 15-foot cone from it. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
