      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>You can place a small keepsake of a creature, such as a miniature portrait, a lock of hair, or similar item, within the locket. The keepsake must be willingly given to you or must be from a creature personally connected to you, such as a relative or lover.<br><em><strong>Communication.</strong></em> While holding or wearing the locket, you can use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.7BrcSoBlBhlIh0MN]{sending}</em> spell from it. The target must be the creature whose keepsake is in the locket. Once used, this property can’t be used again until you have completed a long rest.<br><em><strong>Location.</strong></em> While holding or wearing the locket, you can use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.wAusgnQGjgl6QPD3]{locate creature}</em> spell from it at will. The target must be the creature whose keepsake is in the locket.<br><em><strong>Reminiscence.</strong></em> If the locket contains a keepsake from a dead creature, you can use it to manifest their spirit and speak with them while holding or wearing the locket. This works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.er0d27qCTrTZkpu1]{speak with dead}</em> spell, but the spirit’s answers are typically less cryptic and more helpful. Once used, this property can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
