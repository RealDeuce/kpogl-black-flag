      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This oil grants you lupine features. Each pot contains enough for three applications. One application grants one of the following benefits (your choice): darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, a walking speed of 50 feet, or a new attack option (use the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.shCcNmE8Rqfy6JIf]{wolf’s} bite attack) for 5 minutes.<br>If you use all three applications at one time, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, transforming into a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.shCcNmE8Rqfy6JIf]{wolf}. While you are in the form of a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.shCcNmE8Rqfy6JIf]{wolf}, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
