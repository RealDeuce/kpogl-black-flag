      "value": "<p><em>Wand, common (requires attunement by a druid)</em><br>You can use this wand as a spellcasting focus. The wand has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.LWLrPRZuuucTzy0k]{goodberry}</em> spell while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, you can expend 1 of the wandâ€™s charges to transform the berries into hazelnuts, which restore 2 hit points instead of 1. The spell is otherwise unchanged. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals lightning damage while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals 1 extra lightning damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
