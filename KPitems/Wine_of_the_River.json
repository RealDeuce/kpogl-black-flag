The bottle contains four servings. A creature who drinks a serving of this wine may breathe both air and water for 1 hour. Additionally, the imbiber is filled with knowledge about the elvish forest and gains advantage on Intelligence (history) checks about the forest for 1 hour. Creatures who drink more than one serving within 24 hours must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated for 1d4 hours.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
