      "value": "<p><em>Armor (shield), common (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</em><br>A bronze boss is set in the center of this round shield. When you attune to the shield, the boss changes shape, becoming a symbol of your divine connection: a holy symbol for a cleric or paladin or an engraving of mistletoe or other sacred plant for a druid. You can use the shield as a spellcasting focus for your spells.<br><em><strong>Versatile Cantrip.</strong></em> While holding the shield, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don’t know. The cantrip must be on your spell list, and you must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
