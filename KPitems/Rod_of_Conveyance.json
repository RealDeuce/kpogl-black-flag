      "value": "<p><em>Rod, uncommon</em><br>The top of this rod is capped with a bronze horse head, and its foot is decorated with a horsehair plume. By placing the rod between your legs, you can use an action to temporarily transform the rod into a horse-like construct. This works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.AugUdSLatuwsQ17A]{phantom steed}</em> spell, except you can use a bonus action to end the effect early to use the rod again at a later time. Deduct the time the horse was active in increments of 1 minute from the spellâ€™s 1-hour duration. When the rod has been a horse for a total of 1 hour, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
