      "value": "<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em><br>The tip of this twisted clear glass wand is razorsharp. It can be wielded as a magic dagger that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand weighs 4 pounds and is roughly 18 inches long. When you tap the wand, it emits a single, loud note which can be heard up to 20 feet away and does not stop sounding until you choose to silence it.<br>This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.JVimVp4IvmQTO52h]{arcane lock}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.75HF18ljbTk7wZwC]{disguise self}</em> (1 charge), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.DC1j3Ur40T2ltktm]{tongues}</em> (3 charges).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
