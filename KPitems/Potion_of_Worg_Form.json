      "value": "<p><em>Potion, rare</em><br>Small flecks of brown hair are suspended in this clear, syrupy liquid. When you drink this potion, you transform into a worg for 1 hour. This works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> spell, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. While in worg form, you can speak normally, and you can cast spells that have only verbal components. This transformation doesnâ€™t give you knowledge of the Goblin or Worg languages, and you are able to speak and understand those languages only if you knew them before the transformation.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
