      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This seashell is intricately carved with protective runes. If you are carrying the shell and are reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated, the shell activates, creating a bubble of force that expands to surround you and forces any other creatures out of your space. This sphere works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.tXnBDlCTKcRlzn8w]{wall of force}</em> spell, except that any creature intent on aiding you can pass through it. The protective sphere lasts for 10 minutes, or until you regain at least 1 hit point or are no longer incapacitated. When the protective sphere ends, the shell crumbles to dust.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
