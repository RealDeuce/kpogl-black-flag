      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Prized by gnolls, the upper haft of this spear is decorated with tiny animal skulls, feathers, and other adornments. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.<br>When you hit a creature with this spear, you mark that creature for 1 hour. Until the mark ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with the spear, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find the target. If the target drops to 0 hit points, the mark ends. This property can’t be used on a different creature until you spend a short rest cleaning the previous target’s blood from the spear.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
