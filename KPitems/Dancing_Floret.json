      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This 2-inch-long plant has a humanoid shape, and a large purple flower sits at the top of the plant on a short, neck-like stalk. Small, serrated thorns on its arms and legs allow it to cling to your clothing, and it most often dances along your arm or across your shoulders. While attuned to the floret, you have proficiency in the Performance skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on Charisma (Performance) checks made while dancing.<br>The floret has 3 charges for the following other properties. The floret regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Scintillating Petals.</strong></em> You can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the floret to release scintillating petals. Choose up to three creatures within 20 feet of you. If a target can see the petals, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 as it watches the petals. The effect ends for a target if the target takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it out of its stupor.<br><em><strong>Serrated Twirl.</strong></em> You can use an action and expend 1 charge to command the floret to fling an arcing swirl of serrated leaves. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
