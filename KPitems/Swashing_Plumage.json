      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This plumage, a colorful bouquet of tropical hat feathers, has a small pin at its base and can be affixed to any hat or headband. Due to its distracting, ostentatious appearance, creatures hostile to you have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you.<br><em><strong>Swash.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can flick the plumage with your hand or a toss of your head and choose a creature within 30 feet of you that can see the plumage. The target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, you have advantage on your next attack roll against the target. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
