      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em><br>A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast, small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.<br>The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.<br>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.<br><em><strong>Malachite Selang.</strong></em> This malachite statuette is of a selang, prancing and playing a pan flute. It can become a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPselang00000000]{selang} and play its alien pipes for up to 1 hour. All creatures within 60 feet that can hear it must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the hideous laughter spell. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the piping for 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 3 days have passed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
