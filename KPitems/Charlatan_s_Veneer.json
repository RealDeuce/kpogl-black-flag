When in an area containing 12 or more humanoids, Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot you have disadvantage. You can use a bonus action to call on the power in the scarf to invoke a sense of trust in those to whom you speak. If you do so, you have advantage on the next Charisma (Persuasion) check you make against a humanoid while you are in an area containing 12 or more humanoids.<br>In addition, while wearing the scarf, you can use <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Mh3wANtkgUK1pRDc]{modify memory}</em> on a humanoid you have successfully persuaded in the last 24 hours. The scarf can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
