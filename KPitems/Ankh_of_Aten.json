      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This golden ankh is about 12 inches long and has 5 charges. While holding the ankh by the loop, you can expend 1 charge as an action to fire a beam of brilliant sunlight in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line from the end. Each creature caught in the line must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half damage and isnâ€™t blinded. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. The ankh regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
