      "value": "<p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This plain gold ring features a magnificent ruby. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cause a crimson zipline of magical force to extend from the gem in the ring and attach to up to two solid surfaces you can see. Each surface must be within 150 feet of you. Once the zipline is connected, you can use a bonus action to magically travel up to 50 feet along the line between the two surfaces. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry.<br>While the zipline is active, you remain suspended within 5 feet of the line, floating off the ground at least 3 inches, and you can’t move more than 5 feet away from the zipline. When you magically travel along the line, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks. The hand wearing the ring must be pointed at the line when you magically travel along it, but you otherwise can act normally while the zipline is active. You can use a bonus action to end the zipline.<br>When the zipline has been active for a total of 1 minute, the ring’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
