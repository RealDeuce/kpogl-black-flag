      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This small pebble measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. The pebbles are often shaped like salmon, river clams, or iridescent river rocks. Typically, 1d4 + 4 <em>river tokens</em> are found together. The token gives off a distinct shine in sunlight and radiates a scent of fresh, roiling water. It is sturdy but crumbles easily if crushed.<br>As an action, you can destroy the token by crushing it and sprinkling the remains into a river, calming the waters to a gentle current and soothing nearby water‑dwelling creatures for 1 hour. Water‑dwelling beasts in the river with an Intelligence of 3 or lower are soothed and indifferent toward passing humanoids for the duration. The token’s magic soothes but doesn’t fully suppress the hostilities of all other water-dwelling creatures. For the duration, each other water-dwelling creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to attack or take hostile actions toward passing humanoids. The token’s soothing magic ends on a creature if that creature is attacked.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
