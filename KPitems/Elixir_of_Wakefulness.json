While the elixir is in effect, you canâ€™t fall asleep by normal means. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would put you to sleep. If you are affected by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.pais75ndQesCocfq]{sleep}</em> spell, your current hit points are considered 10 higher when determining the effects of the spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
