      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (javelin), uncommon</em><br>The metallic head of this javelin is embellished with three small wings. When you speak a command word while making a ranged weapon attack with this magic weapon, a swirling vortex of wind follows its path through the air. Draw a line between you and the target of your attack; each creature within 10 feet of this line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed backward 10 feet and falls prone.<br>In addition, if this ranged weapon attack hits, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed backward 15 feet and falls prone.<br>The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic weapon.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
