      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)</em><br>This gold-shod staff is constructed out of a piece of masting from a galleon. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you are on board a ship, this bonus increases to +2.<br>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all of its magic and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.opNXroFgQIdwz1MU]{control water}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.cvyXEJ2dVH7aG5Px]{fog cloud}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.0u1CqWulRC8QY1X6]{gust of wind}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.saVflOr3xsvwHSX4]{water walk}</em> (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.qCQ8MTaMrNXb5E7c]{ray of frost}</em> cantrip from the staff without using any charges.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
