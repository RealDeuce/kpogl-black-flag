      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>The backs of each of these black leather gloves are set with gold fittings as if to hold a jewel. While you wear the gloves, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.z0bwd75DutQ7TOcY]{mage hand}</em> at will. You can affix an <em>ioun stone</em> into the fitting on a glove. While the stone is affixed, you gain the benefits of the stone as if you had it in orbit around your head. If you take an action to touch a creature, you can transfer the benefits of the <em>ioun stone</em> to that creature for 1 hour. While the creature is gifted the benefits, the stone turns gray and provides you with no benefits for the duration. You can use an action to end this effect and return power to the stone. The stone’s benefits can also be dispelled from a creature as if they were a 7th‑level spell. When the effect ends, the stone regains its color and provides you with its benefits once more.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
