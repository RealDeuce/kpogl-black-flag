      "value": "<p><em><strong>Availability:</strong> Rare spear, 100 gp</em><br>The massive spears used by some of the centaur tribes are made from heavy wood and iron bands. Nearing 12 feet in length, creatures of Medium size and smaller may not effectively throw these weapons.

Clever Winter Folk have devised combat maneuvers that involve two halflings set to one spear.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
