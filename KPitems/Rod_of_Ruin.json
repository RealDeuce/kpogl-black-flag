      "value": "<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This rough rod feels as though it is made of petrified wood, and in fact looks like nothing so much as an ancient quarterstaff that has had a third of its length broken off.<br>While holding this rod, you and any creatures within 100 feet of you that you identify as allies are immune to thunder damage from an angel of war’s warsong and have advantage on saving throws against other thunder damage.<br>In ages past, this rod was called the <em>battle singer’s redoubt</em>. Its current name derives from dust goblin legends.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
