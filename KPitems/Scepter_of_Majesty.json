When you finish speaking, 1d6 creatures that failed their saving throw are affected as if by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5mipsDCRlAEIpZXs]{dominate person}</em> spell. Each such creature treats you as its ruler, obeying your commands and automatically fighting in your defense should anyone attempt to harm you. If you are also attuned to and wearing a <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressitems.Item.KPheaddressofmaj]{headdress of majesty}</em>, your charmed subjects have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that attacked you or that cast an obvious spell on you within the last round.
