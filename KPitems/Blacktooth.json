      "value": "<p><em>Wand, legendary</em><br>This black ivory, rune-carved wand has 7 charges. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.3W28zEVxPGjDRqUX]{guiding bolt}</em> spell from it, using an attack bonus of +7. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.<br><em><strong>Beguiler of Darkness (Requires Attunement).</strong></em> You must be a fiend or undead spellcaster or a spellcaster with fiendish or undead heritage to attune to this wand. While you are attuned to this wand, it can hold up to 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Ez1IJ81JoObreBGf]{calm emotions}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.lkBDXbx2O78UA8gz]{command}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5mipsDCRlAEIpZXs]{dominate monster}</em> (8 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.kVXub5YGKOSXv8ix]{hold monster}</em> (5 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.iw5BfQdWrDssHFWZ]{suggestion}</em> (2 charges). These spells can target and affect only fiends and undead creatures, but they otherwise work like the indicated spells. A target that is immune to the charmed condition can be affected by a spell cast from this wand, however that target has advantage on its saving throw against the spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
