      "value": "<p><em>Rod, uncommon</em><br>Crafted from the root burl of a sacred tree, this rod is 2 feet long with a spiked, knobby end. Runes inlaid with gold decorate the full length of the rod. This rod functions as a magic mace.<br><em><strong>Blood Anointment.</strong></em> You can perform a 1-minute ritual to anoint the rod in your blood. If you do, your hit point maximum is reduced by 2d4 until you finish a long rest. While your hit point maximum is reduced in this way, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and, when you hit a fey or giant with this weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage.<br><em><strong>Holy Anointment.</strong></em> If you spend 1 minute anointing the rod with a flask of holy water, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.CnNNEgO2tpR1uMZ6]{augury}</em> spell from it. The runes carved into the rod glow and move, forming an answer to your query.<br>Alternatively, if you spend 10 minutes anointing the rod with a flask of holy water, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5XC70iK7GvVRh0xx]{divination}</em> spell from it.
