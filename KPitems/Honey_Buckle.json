While you are in the form of a bear, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The belt buckle can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Black Honey Buckle (Uncommon).</strong></em> When you use this belt buckle to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, you transform into a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.BLi3PwiKwa4TVWVB]{black bear}.<br><em><strong>Brown Honey Buckle (Rare).</strong></em> When you use this belt buckle to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, you transform into a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.2Uyw9ZrqRJur5bwE]{brown bear.}<br><em><strong>White Honey Buckle (Very Rare).</strong></em> When you use this belt buckle to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, you transform into a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.JHttBWIKfW7bFVtr]{polar bear}.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
