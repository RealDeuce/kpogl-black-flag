      "value": "<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>The tips of this twisted wooden wand are exceptionally withered. The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand disintegrates into useless white powder.<br><em><strong>Affliction.</strong></em> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to become afflicted with unsightly, weeping sores. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all Dexterity and Charisma checks for 1 minute. An afflicted creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><em><strong>Pain.</strong></em> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to become wracked with terrible pain. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 necrotic damage, and its movement speed is halved for 1 minute. A pained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself a success. If the target is also suffering from the Affliction property of this wand, it has disadvantage on the saving throw.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
