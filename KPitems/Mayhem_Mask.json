      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This goat mask with long, curving horns is carved from dark wood and framed in goat’s hair. While wearing this mask, you can use its horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your horns deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you moved at least 15 feet straight toward the target before you attacked with the horns, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier instead.<br>In addition, you can gaze through the eyes of the mask at one target you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though it failed a saving throw against the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Bcm0RKcg5os0dDhC]{confusion}</em> spell. The <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Bcm0RKcg5os0dDhC]{confusion}</em> effect lasts for 1 minute. Once used, this property of the mask can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
