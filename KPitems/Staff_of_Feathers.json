      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em><br>Several eagle feathers line the top of this long, thin staff. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes into a mass of eagle feathers and is destroyed.<br><em><strong>Feather Travel.</strong></em> When you are targeted by a ranged attack while holding the staff, you can use a reaction to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. When you do, you briefly transform into a mass of feathers, and the attack misses. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.9nMxGFyHBXufsUnu]{conjure animals}</em> (2 giant eagles only, 3 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.9m3weZVFQcscp85O]{fly}</em> (3 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.0u1CqWulRC8QY1X6]{gust of wind}</em> (2 charges).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
