      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This ordinary bag, made from cured animal hide, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a number of flat, bone tiles. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.<br>You can use an action to pull one of the tiles from the bag and throw it into the air in front of you. The tile floats 5 feet off the ground and displays a runic symbol. Make a DC 12 Wisdom check. The symbol on the tile is upright on a successful save, and it is reversed on a failed save. Roll a d12 and consult the appropriate table to determine the rune’s effect. If a result requires a saving throw, the DC is 15. The tile vanishes after it displays a rune, but the bag never runs out of tiles.<br>Once used, the bag shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, the DC of the Wisdom check increases by 5 for each tile drawn after the first. You can be affected by more than one rune’s effect at a time.<br>Unless otherwise noted, each rune’s effect lasts until you finish a long rest.<br><h2>Upright Runestone</h2><table><tr><th>d12</th><th>Rune</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Ansuz</td><td>Truth</td><td>When this rune appears, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.6PXublV5eymPa56L]{zone of truth}</em> spell is triggered, centered on you, and it moves with you for 1 hour.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Naudiz</td><td>Necessity</td><td>You have advantage on the next saving throw you make before this effect ends.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Hagalaz</td><td>Winter</td><td>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.qzHBcRIxWK8H6zXo]{ice storm}</em> spell once before this effect ends.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Laukaz</td><td>Sea</td><td>You can breathe air and water for 5 hours.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Algiz</td><td>Protection</td><td>You gain a +2 bonus to AC.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Mannaz</td><td>Teamwork</td><td>You and up to five creatures of your choice that you can see gain 10 temporary hit points.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Isaz</td><td>Ice</td><td>When you hit with an attack, the attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Berkanan</td><td>Bear Maiden</td><td>You can use an action to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, transforming into a brown bear.
