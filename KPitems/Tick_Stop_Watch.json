      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>While holding this silver pocketwatch, you can use an action to magically stop a single clockwork device or construct within 10 feet of you. If the target is an object, it freezes in place, even mid-air, for up to 1 minute or until moved. If the target is a construct, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn. The pocketwatch canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>The pocketwatch must be wound at least once every 24 hours, just like a normal pocketwatch, or its magic ceases to function. If left unwound for 24 hours, the watch loses its magic, but the power returns 24 hours after the next time it is wound.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
