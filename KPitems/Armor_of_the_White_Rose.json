      "value": "<p><em>Armor (Heavy), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>You are immune to necrotic and cold damage and vulnerable to fire and radiant damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you are imbued with soul-devouring energy. When you hit with a melee attack, the target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain 3d6 hit points. If you gain hit points above your maximum, you immediately gain a level of exhaustion, and the soul-devouring power of the armor ends until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
