      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This painting appears to be a well-rendered piece of scenery, devoid of subjects. You can spend 5 feet of movement to step into the painting. The painting then appears to be a portrait of you, against whatever background was already present. While in the painting, you are immobile unless you use a bonus action to exit the painting. Your senses still function, and you can use them as if you were in the portraitâ€™s space.<br>You remain unharmed if the painting is damaged, but if it is destroyed, you are immediately shunted into the nearest unoccupied space.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
