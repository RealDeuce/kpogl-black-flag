      "value": "<p><em>Armor (leather or hide), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This armor was made from the remains of a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPwhiteape000000]{white ape} that fell in battle. While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, the armor has the following properties while you wear it.<br><em><strong>White Ape’s Speed.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can gain a climbing speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once used, this property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>White Ape’s Strength.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can call on the power of the white ape. For 1 minute, you have advantage on Strength and Constitution ability checks and saving throws, and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons. Once used, this property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>White Ape’s Wasting.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to imbue the weapon with disease. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the arcane wasting disease. It takes 1d6 days for arcane wasting’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature, which include forgetfulness and minor delirium. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are each reduced by 1d3. The creature dies if this reduces either score to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The creature recovers from the disease by making two consecutive successful saving throws. The <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Aqff6XGGmiVXo6A6]{lesser restoration}</em> spell cures the disease if the spellcaster succeeds on a DC 15 spellcasting check. Once used, this property of the armor can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
