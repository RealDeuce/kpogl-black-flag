      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em><br>Formed from a single piece of dull-gray metal, the <em>spire key</em> is bent in the shape of a triangle, 8 inches on each side, with one of the vertices left open, so the ends of the bar are not quite touching. The key is engraved with ornate scrollwork patterns and is usually worn on a chain. It is unknown how many spire keys were made, but each one was given to an individual arcane engineer in Galaâ€™ikos by their patron titan and bears both of their names in the Titan script.<br>You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing or carrying the <em>spire key</em>. When the triangle is struck with a suitable implement within 30 feet of the Nexus Spire, the sound it gives off causes a section of the tower wall to become insubstantial for 1 minute.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
