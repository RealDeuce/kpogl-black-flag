      "value": "<p><em>Wand, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This wand of petrified wood has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend up to 3 of its charges to harm a plant or plant creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 necrotic damage for each charge you expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand shatters and is destroyed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
