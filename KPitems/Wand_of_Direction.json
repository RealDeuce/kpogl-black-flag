      "value": "<p><em>Wand, common</em><br>This crooked, twisting wand is crafted of polished ebony with a small, silver arrow affixed to its tip. The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to make the wand remember your path for up to 1,760 feet of movement. You can increase the length of the path the wand remembers by 1,760 feet for each additional charge you expend. When you expend a charge to make the wand remember your current path, the wand forgets the oldest path of up to 1,760 feet that it remembers.<br>If you wish to retrace your steps, you can use a bonus action to activate the wand’s arrow. The arrow guides you, pointing and mentally tugging you in the direction you should go. The wand’s magic allows you to backtrack with complete accuracy despite being lost, unable to see, or similar hindrances against finding your way. The wand can’t counter or dispel magic effects that cause you to become lost or misguided, but it can guide you back in spite of some magic hindrances, such as guiding you through the area of a darkness spell or guiding you if you had activated the wand then forgotten the way due to the effects of the modify memory spell on you.<br>The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand straightens and the arrow falls off, rendering it nonmagical.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
