      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>These low, soft boots are fashioned of enchanted snowshoe rabbit pelts and have wide, overlong soles. Icy terrain doesnâ€™t impede your movement, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snow.<br>Additionally, on speaking the command word, you gain +15 feet of movement, plus your jump distance is tripled. When this property has been used for a total of 1 hour, the magic ceases to function until you finish a short or long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
