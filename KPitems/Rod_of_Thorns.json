      "value": "<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Several long sharp thorns sprout along the edge of this stout wooden rod, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the spike growth spell (save DC 15) from it.<br><em><strong>Embed Thorn.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with this rod, you can expend 1 of its charges to embed a thorn in the creature. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 piercing damage from the embedded thorn. If the creature succeeds on two saving throws, the thorn falls out and crumbles to dust. The successes don’t need to be consecutive. If the creature dies while the thorn is embedded, its body transforms into a patch of nonmagical brambles, which fill its space with difficult terrain.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
