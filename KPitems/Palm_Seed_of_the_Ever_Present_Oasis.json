      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>When buried at least a foot deep in sand, this hand‑sized palm seed sprouts overnight into a 12-foot‑tall palm tree and causes a spring to erupt next to it. The spring creates either a 20-foot pool that’s 2 feet deep; a 15-foot pool that’s 3-1/2 feet deep; or a 10-foot pool that’s 8 feet deep, full of cool clean water that refills to its depth every other day. The tree grows normally, and if it is ever cut down and the palm seed pulled out of its roots, the oasis dries up until the seed is planted again.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
