      "value": "<p><em>Potion, Uncommon</em><br>This wine, so dark red in color it is nearly black, pours from its bottle in a syrupy flow. When you drink it, you taste notes of sour apple, bitter ash, and jealousy, and your thoughts are occupied with vivid memories of heartbreak and loss.<br>When you drink this wine, you have disadvantage on Charisma ability checks for 1 hour, but you are immune to being charmed and can add your proficiency bonus to Wisdom saving throws for the duration. If you already add your proficiency bonus to Wisdom saving throws, your bonus is instead doubled for the duration.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
