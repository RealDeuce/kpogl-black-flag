      "value": "<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>This staff of petrified wood is topped with a stylized carving of a bat with spread wings, a mouth baring great fangs, and a pair of ruby eyes. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. As long as the staff holds at least 1 charge, you can communicate with bats as if you shared a language. Bat and bat-like beasts and monstrosities never attack you unless magically forced to do so or unless you attack them first.<br>While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.zAdVL033HkTXL6Nq]{darkness}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5mipsDCRlAEIpZXs]{dominate monster}</em> (8 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.zN7iox5s7uic3PTH]{flame strike}</em> (5 charges).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
