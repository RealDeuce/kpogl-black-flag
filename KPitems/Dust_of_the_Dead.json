      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This stoppered vial is filled with dust and ash. There is enough of it for one use.<br>When you use an action to sprinkle the dust on a willing humanoid, the target falls into a death-like slumber for 8 hours. While asleep, the target appears dead to all mundane and magical means, but spells that target the dead, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.er0d27qCTrTZkpu1]{speak with dead}</em> spell, fail when used on the target. The cause of death is not evident, though any wounds the target has taken remain visible. If the target takes damage while asleep, it has resistance to the damage. If the target is reduced to below half its hit points while asleep, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to wake up. If the target is reduced to 5 hit points or fewer while asleep, it wakes up.<br>If the target is unwilling, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to avoid the effect of the dust. A sleeping creature is considered an unwilling target.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
