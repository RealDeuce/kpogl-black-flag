      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (halberd or spear), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>From a distance, this weapon bears a passing resemblance to a fallen tree branch. When wielded in battle, each of the small, branching spear points attached to the polearmâ€™s shaft pulses with a warm glow and burns with the desire to protect the righteous. When not using it, you can fold the branches inward and sheathe the polearm in a leather wrap.<br>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you hold this weapon, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. You can fold and wrap the weapon as an action, extinguishing the light. While holding or carrying the weapon, you have resistance to piercing damage.<br>The weapon has 10 charges for the following other properties. The weapon regains 1d8 + 2 charges daily at dawn. In addition, it regains 1 charge when exposed to powerful magical sunlight, such as the light created by the sunbeam and sunburst spells, and it regains 1 charge each round it remains exposed to such sunlight.<br><em><strong>Spike Barrage.</strong></em> While wielding this weapon, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges and sweep the weapon in a small arc to release a barrage of spikes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 piercing damage for each charge you expend on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><em><strong>Spiked Wall.</strong></em> While wielding this weapon, you can use an action to expend 6 charges to cast the wall of thorns spell (save DC 17) from it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
