      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Created by the Wind Lords, these shining steel scimitars are sometimes wielded by Tamasheq chieftains and imajaghans. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with the scimitar, you can call upon the power of the Wind Lords to push it away from you unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If the creature fails, it is pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction of your choice and knocked prone. While attuned to this scimitar, you are not affected by the extreme heat of the desert during the day or by the extreme cold at night.<br><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> This is the original item from the setting book.
