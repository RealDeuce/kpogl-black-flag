      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>From a distance, this long, black cloak appears to be in tatters, but a closer inspection reveals that it is sewn from numerous scraps of cloth and shaped like bat wings. While wearing this cloak, you can use your action to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, transforming into a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.xr4I1f60XZGqtaOe]{swarm of bats}. While in the form of a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.xr4I1f60XZGqtaOe]{swarm of bats}, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. If you are a druid with the Wild Shape feature, this transformation instead lasts as long as your Wild Shape lasts. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
