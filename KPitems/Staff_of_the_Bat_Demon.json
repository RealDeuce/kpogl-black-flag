      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (staff), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This staff of petrified wood is topped with a stylized carving of a bat, its wings spread, its mouth baring great fangs, and a pair of rubies inset as its eyes. As long as the staff holds at least 1 charge, the bearer can speak with animals at will (bats only). Living bats of any size never attack the bearer of the <em>staff of the demon bad</em> unless magically compelled to, such as conjured or magically controlled bats. Batlike creatures with Intelligence 3 or higher have an indifferent starting attitude toward the wielder. The staff has five charges and regains 1d4 charges after each long rest. It provides its bearer access to the following spells:<ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.zAdVL033HkTXL6Nq]{darkness}</em> (1 charge)</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5mipsDCRlAEIpZXs]{dominate monster}</em> (bats and batlike creatures only, 2 charges)</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.zN7iox5s7uic3PTH]{flame strike}</em> (2 charges)</li><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
