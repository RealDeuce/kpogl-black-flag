      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>While wearing this crown, you can use an action to meld an item into or retrieve an item from the body of a living creature. The item cannot be larger than the area of the body it is being melded with. The process leaves behind only a stitched scar, shaped like the melded object’s silhouette. Any objects melded into a body become part of it and cannot cause harm, though nonharmful side effects of the object may still occur: such as, for example, a poison that discolors a victim’s skin will not harm the creature but will still discolor the skin. Once used, this crown can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
