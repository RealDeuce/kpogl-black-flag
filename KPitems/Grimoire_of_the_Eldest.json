      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>Anyone who reads this volume detailing the foundations of the cult of the void, said to be bound in leather made from human skin, gains 1 point of void taint. It contains all spells with the <strong>void</strong> or <strong>mythos</strong> keyword and can be used to learn any and all of them. It also functions as a direct portal to the purest essence of the Void, a source of alien wisdom that answers questions and prophesizes the future with frightening accuracy.<br>You can pose a question to the <em>grimoire of the eldest</em>, making a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you know the answer, as if a commune or a legend lore spell had been cast successfully. On a failed save, you gain 1 point of void taint.
