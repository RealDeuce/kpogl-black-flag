      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (club), uncommon</em><br>This knobbed stick is marked with nicks, scratches, and notches. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br>While wielding the club, you can use an action to tap it against your open palm, the side of your leg, a surface within reach, or similar. If you do, you have advantage on your next Charisma (Intimidation) check. If you are also wearing a rowdy’s ring (see page 87), you can use an action to frighten a creature you can see within 30 feet of you instead. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn. Once this special action has been used three times, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
