      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This pyramid-shaped lantern has clear crystal sides and is made of black iron woven with sparkling silver.<br>While holding the lantern, you can use an action to speak its command word. The lantern floats 2 feet away from you at shoulder height, and sheds bright light in a 30-foot-radius sphere and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You and any of your companions within 30 feet of the lantern while it is shedding light can’t be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. When you are in the Shadow Realm, the lantern also emits a pinpoint of light in the direction of the city in which it was crafted.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
