      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (war pick), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This small rusty iron anchor feels sturdy in spite of its appearance. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic war pick.<br>When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target is wrapped in ethereal golden chains that extend from the bottom of the anchor. As an action, the chained target can make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check, freeing itself from the chains on a success. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the chains to disappear, freeing the target. The chains are constructed of magical force and can’t be damaged, though they can be destroyed with a @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.gRODtP9C3Vkq7CFJ]{disintegrate} spell. While the target is wrapped in these chains, you and the target can’t move further than 50 feet from each other.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
