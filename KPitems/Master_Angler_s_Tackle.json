      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>This is a set of well-worn but finely crafted fishing gear. You have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) checks made to catch fish or other seafood when using it.<br>If you ever roll a 1 on your check while using the tackle, roll again. If the second roll is a 20, you still fail to catch anything edible, but you pull up something interesting or valuable—a bottle with a note in it, a fragment of an ancient tablet carved in ancient script, a mermaid in need of help, or similar. The GM decides what you pull up and its value, if it has one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
