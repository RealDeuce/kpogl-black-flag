      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em><br>This gauzy, charcoal-dyed cloak clasps around the neck, falling over any pack or lying comfortably underneath without impairing movement. Three times per long rest, you may, as a reaction that does not provoke opportunity attacks, activate the shroud to gain the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.AGXXq1EcLVPFMVPh]{sanctuary}</em> spell for 30 minutes (DC 15). Creatures who succeed against the save cannot be affected by it again until after youâ€™ve taken a long rest.<br>In addition, you are invisible to constructs and undead (as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.PKj2TSp0iwaPZulb]{invisibility}</em> spell). They cannot see you unless you act against them or the effect is dispelled. (The shroud is considered a 4th-level effect for dispelling attempts.)<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
