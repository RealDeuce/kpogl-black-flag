      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em><br>This small bauble consists of a flat crescent, which binds a small disc that freely spins in its housing. Each side of the disc is intricately etched with an incomplete pillar and pyre.<br><em><strong>Pillar of Fire.</strong></em> While holding this bauble, you can use an action to remove the disc, place it on the ground, and speak its command word to transform it into a 5-foot-tall flaming pillar of intricately carved stone. The pillar sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. It is warm to the touch, but it doesn’t burn. A second command word returns the pillar to its disc form. When the pillar has shed light for a total of 10 minutes, it returns to its disc form and can’t be transformed into a pillar again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Recall Magic.</strong></em> While holding this bauble, you can use an action to spin the disc and regain one expended 1st-level spell slot. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
