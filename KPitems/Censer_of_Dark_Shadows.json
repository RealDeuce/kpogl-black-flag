      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This enchanted censer paints the air with magical, smoky shadow. While holding the censer, you can use an action to speak its command word, causing the censer to emit shadow in a 30-foot radius for 1 hour. Bright light and sunlight within this area is reduced to dim light, and dim light within this area is reduced to magical darkness. The shadow spreads around corners, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate this shadow.<br>The shadow emanates from the censer and moves with it. Completely enveloping the censer within another sealed object, such as a lidded pot or a leather bag, blocks the shadow. If any of this effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.<br>Once the censer is used to emit shadow, it can’t do so again until the next dusk.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
