      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This finely crafted water pipe is made from silver and glass. Its vase is etched with arcane symbols. When you spend 1 minute using the sheeshah to smoke normal or flavored tobacco, you enter a dreamlike state and are granted a cryptic or surreal vision giving you insight into your current quest or a significant event in your near future. This effect works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.5XC70iK7GvVRh0xx]{divination}</em> spell. Once used, you canâ€™t use the sheeshah in this way again until 7 days have passed or until the events hinted at in your vision have come to pass, whichever happens first.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
