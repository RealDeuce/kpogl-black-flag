      "value": "<p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>A pale chrysoprase cut into the shape of a frog is the centerpiece of this tarnished copper ring. While wearing this ring, you have a swimming speed of 20 feet, and you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.<br><em><strong>Frog Tongue.</strong></em> You can use an action transform your tongue into one resembling that of a frog or toad for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You can elongate your tongue out to a distance of 20 feet, and your tongue can pick up or hold an object weighing no more than 10 pounds. To grab an item that is being worn or carried, you must still succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, ranged attack, or similar check, as determined by your GM. The tongue retracts into your mouth when not in use and has no impact on your ability to speak or cast spells with verbal components. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
