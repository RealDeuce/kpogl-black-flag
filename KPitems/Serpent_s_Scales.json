      "value": "<p><em>Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While wearing this armor made from the skin of a giant snake, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have resistance to poison damage.<br>While wearing the armor, you can use an action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a giant poisonous snake. While you are in the form of a snake, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The armor can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
