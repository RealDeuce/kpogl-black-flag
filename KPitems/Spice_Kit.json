      "value": "<p><em><strong>Availability:</strong> Uncommon cook's utensils, 10 gp</em><br>This cook’s accessory consists of a large belt pouch with many small compartments sewn into its interior. Each compartment contains a spice (thyme, pepper, Winter Folk ginger root, centaur mustard, etc.) Creatures who are proficient with cook’s utensils may use these spices to create delicious meals from ingredients that might otherwise be bland. These cooks may make a DC 5 Intelligence check during a long rest to use the spices in their cooking. Creatures who eat the resulting meal may regain one additional hit die up to their normal maximum. A failed check results in an edible but overly spiced meal.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
