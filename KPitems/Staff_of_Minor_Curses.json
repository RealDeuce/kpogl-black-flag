      "value": "<p><em>Staff, common</em><br>This twisted, wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to inflict a minor curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be affected by the chosen curse. A minor curse causes a non-debilitating effect or change in the creature, such as an outbreak of boils on one section of the target’s skin, intermittent hiccupping, transforming the target’s ears into small, donkey-like ears, or similar effects. The curse never interrupts spellcasting and never causes disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws. The curse lasts for 24 hours or until removed by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.1CSuwbYVhlmZMNGM]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic.<br>The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff dissolves into a cloud of noxious gas, and you are targeted with a minor curse of the GM’s choice.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
