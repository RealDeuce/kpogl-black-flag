      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This silver torc is set with a large opal on one end, and it thins to a point on the other. While wearing the torc, you have resistance to cold damage, and you can use an action to speak the command word, causing the torc to shed bluish-white bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again.<br>The torc has 4 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and fire a tiny comet from the torc at a target you can see within 120 feet of you. The torc makes a ranged attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 cold damage. At night, the cold damage dealt by the comets increases to 6d6. The torc regain 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
