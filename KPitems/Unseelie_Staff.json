      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>This ebony staff is decorated in silver and topped with a jagged piece of obsidian. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. While holding the staff, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence or interact socially with fey creatures.<br>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff dissolves into a shower of powdery snow, which blows away in a sudden, chill wind.<br><em><strong>Rebuke Fey.</strong></em> When you hit a fey creature with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to the target. If the fey has a good alignment, the extra damage increases to 4d6, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.pw72u0bgcIKLtSBM]{charm person}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.0DJYzsH6997OXOEp]{conjure woodland beings}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.Bcm0RKcg5os0dDhC]{confusion}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.PKj2TSp0iwaPZulb]{invisibility}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.NJKjBBmBG98Lo2XY]{teleport}</em> (7 charges).
