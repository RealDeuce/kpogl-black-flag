      "value": "<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This rod of polished, silvery metal resembles a scepter. It has an eye fashioned at the top of it, flanked by a pair of wings. The octagonal rod narrows into a sharp point at the other end. You can wield the rod as a javelin, and it counts as a magic weapon. When you are attuned to the rod, you are unaffected by spells and other magical effects that would reduce your speed or cause you to become paralyzed or restrained (including the temporal effects described in this adventure). The rod has 3 charges. You can expend a charge from the rod to cast freedom of movement on a target as an action by touching a creature with the rod or to cast knock by touching an object. The rod regains all expended charges at dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
