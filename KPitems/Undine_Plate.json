      "value": "<p><em>Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This bright green plate armor is embossed with images of various marine creatures, such as octopuses and rays. While wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you don’t have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while underwater.<br><em><strong>Seawater Shield.</strong></em> While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to surround yourself in a sheath of seawater until the start of your next turn. While sheathed in seawater, you have resistance to fire damage, and you are heavily obscured from melee and ranged attacks against you. The seawater doesn’t obscure your vision. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
