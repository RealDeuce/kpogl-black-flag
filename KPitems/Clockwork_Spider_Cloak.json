      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This hooded cloak is made from black spider silk and has thin brass ribbing stitched on the inside. It has 3 charges. While wearing the cloak, you gain a +2 bonus on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to animate the brass ribs into articulated spider legs 1 inch thick and 6 feet long for 1 minute. You can use the charges in succession. The spider legs allow you to climb at your normal walking speed, and you double your proficiency bonus and gain advantage on any Strength (Athletics) checks made for slippery or difficult surfaces. The cloak regains 1d3 charges each day at sunset.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
