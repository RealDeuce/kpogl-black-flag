      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This cap is a simple, blue silk hat with a goose feather trim. While wearing this cap, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb, and the cap deflects the first ranged attack made against you each round.<br>In addition, when a creature attacks you while within 30 feet of you, it is illuminated and sheds red-hued dim light in a 50-foot radius until the end of its next turn. Any attack roll against an illuminated creature has advantage if the attacker can see it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
