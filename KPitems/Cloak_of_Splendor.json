      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em><br>This cloak is made of fine ermine and often embellished with fasteners or trimmed with gold or embroidered orange candles, suns, or similar symbols. While wearing this cloak, you can grip it’s edges and generate a <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.dsLd4UbIYEYgf6EX]{sunbeam}</em> spell once per day. If you release the cloak’s edges from your grasp, the light fades, and you cannot generate further lines of radiance.<br>In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can use your action to generate a set of 10 magical lights once per day, each as bright as a lantern and shedding full sunlight in a 20-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any or all the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 30 feet of another light created by this cloak, and a light winks out if travels more than 100 feet from you.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
