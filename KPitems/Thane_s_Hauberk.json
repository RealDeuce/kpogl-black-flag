You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this breastplate.<br>Whenever you are struck by a melee attack while wearing the breastplate, you may use your reaction to expend one use of your uses of Bardic Inspiration. If you do, roll your Bardic Inspiration die twice: you reduce the damage of the attack by the result of the first roll, and the triggering target takes lightning damage equal to the result of the second roll.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
