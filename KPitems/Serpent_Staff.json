      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>Fashioned from twisted ash wood, this staff ’s head is carved in the likeness of a serpent preparing to strike. You have resistance to poison damage while you hold this staff.<br>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the carved snake head twists and magically consumes the rest of the staff, destroying it.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.SWHhgfmpmywT2kJo]{cloudkill}</em> (5 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.fJRDxf6O1Qd6vSZE]{detect poison and disease}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressspells.Item.KPpoisonedvolley]{poisoned volley}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.oLoG89ESOdDLCEKI]{protection from poison}</em> (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.DlGDzuYub1O7kkHX]{poison spray}</em> spell from the staff without using any charges.<br><em><strong>Serpent Form.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.izAYjuiXEYPJat3R]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, transforming into a serpent or snake that has a challenge rating of 2 or lower. While you are in the form of a serpent, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can remain in serpent form for up to 1 minute, and you can revert to your normal form as an action. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl-bf.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
